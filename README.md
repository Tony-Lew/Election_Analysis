# Election_Analysis

Create an Election Analysis "PyPoll" with Python
## Overview of Project
A Colorado Board of Elections has requested to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculatae the total number of votes each candidate received.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.66.0

## Summary

- The voter turnout for each county was:
  - Aprapahoe turned out 6.7% of the voters, for a total voter count of 24,801.
  - Denver turned out 82.8% of the voters, for a total voter count of 306,055.
  - Jefferson turned out 10.5% of the voter, for a total voter count of 38,855.

- The County with the largest voter turnout was:
  - Denver, which contained 82.8% of the total votes cast, a total of 306,055. 



## Election-Audit Summary
The code I have written can be easily modified for any future elections with a few small changes. We could also dive deeper into each county to determine what percentage of the county voted for what candidate. This would be usefull in the future incase the voter turnout is not what it should be. You would be able to concentrate your efforts in getting the public to vote in these areas. Also having this program can determine the winner in much less time.
